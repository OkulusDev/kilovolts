# kilovolts
An open, fast and simple python PCB board emulator

## About
In our "Kilovolts" PCB emulator, there is a component class and a linear component class, which serve as parent classes for other components (such as the resistor linear component and the transistor regular component). There is a system of connections using wires. Currently, interaction is only available through Python code, but a GUI interface will be implemented in the future.

## Installion
Install python3 on your operation system

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OkulusDev/kilovolts
cd kilovolts
python3 kilovolts.py
```
